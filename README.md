# Cloud DevOps: Operationalize a Machine Learning API

In this project, you will apply the skills you have acquired in this course to operationalize a Machine Learning Microservice API.

You are given a pre-trained, sklearn model that has been trained to predict housing prices in Boston according to several features, such as average rooms in a home and data about highway access, teacher-to-pupil ratios, and so on. You can read more about the data, which was initially taken from Kaggle, on the data source site. This project tests your ability to operationalize a Python flask app—in a provided file, app.py—that serves out predictions (inference) about housing prices through API calls. This project could be extended to any pre-trained machine learning model, such as those for image recognition and data labeling.

## Project Tasks

Your project goal is to operationalize this working, machine learning microservice using [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), which is an open-source system for automating the management of containerized applications. In this project you will:
* Test your project code using linting
* Complete a Dockerfile to containerize this application
* Deploy your containerized application using Docker and make a prediction
* Improve the log statements in the source code for this application
* Configure Kubernetes and create a Kubernetes cluster
* Deploy a container using Kubernetes and make a prediction
* Upload a complete Github repo with CircleCI to indicate that your code has been tested

You can find a detailed [project rubric, here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2576/view).

**The final implementation of the project will showcase your abilities to operationalize production microservices.**

## Setup the Environment

* Create a virtualenv with Python 3.7 and activate it. Refer to this link for help on specifying the Python version in the virtualenv. 
```bash
python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
# You should have Python 3.7 available in your host. 
# Check the Python path using `which python3`
# Use a command similar to this one:
python3 -m virtualenv --python=<path-to-Python3.7> .devops
source .devops/bin/activate
```
* Run `make install` to install the necessary dependencies

### Running `app.py`

1. Standalone:  `python app.py`
2. Run in Docker:  `./run_docker.sh`
3. Run in Kubernetes:  `./run_kubernetes.sh`

### Kubernetes Steps

* Setup and Configure Docker locally
* Setup and Configure Kubernetes locally
* Create Flask app in Container
* Run via kubectl

# Implementation
### Installation Guide

- Docker
- Virtualbox

For Mac:

```
brew install --cask virtualbox
```

- Minikube

```
brew install --cask minikube
```

### Files explanation
- config.yml: CircleCI configuration file for ensuring the code passes lint test
- app.py: Python flask app that serves out predictions (inference) about housing prices through API calls
- Dockerfile: Dockerfile for building the image
- make_prediction.sh: Send a request to the Python flask app to get a prediction
- Makefile: includes instructions on environment setup and lint tests
- run_docker.sh: file to be able to get Docker running, locally
- run_kubernetes.sh: file to run the app in kubernetes
- upload_docker.sh: file to upload the image to Dockerhub


### Run the project


1. You should have a virtual machine like VirtualBox and minikube installed, as per the project environmet instructions. To start a local cluster, type the terminal command: 
```
minikube start
```

2. To deploy this application in kubernetes run:
```
./run_kubernetes.sh
```

3. After you’ve called run_kubernetes.sh, and a pod is up and running, make a prediction using a separate terminal tab and run 
```
./make_prediction.sh
```

4. Delete the cluster
```
minikube delete
```
